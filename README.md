# Personal Agenda

This project is a simple personal agenda that allows users to create a task that can be set in the present, the next day or future. This web application operates with CRUD functions and webSQL as a database to store user inputs.

## How it was built

The development process of this project was done in visual studio code. 
The programming languages used for this devlopment are:
* JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5/CSS3
*  Heroku

## Purpose 

The reason and usefulness for this project is to provide a convenient way for users, such as students or anyone with a need or interest in an agenda application. The home page consists of the starting points for the creating a task. So far, three buttons are displayed that will link the user to the same page; although they would need to specify (not required) the tense of the task so it links to the button they've selected. A real time digital clock is displayed in the UI of the home page to give the user a sense of time. The application has two database tables running in the background. One of the tables ("Tense") is dependent on the main table, “Agenda”. The Agenda table stores values for user input. 

These inputs include the following:
•	Title of the task or topic (textbox input)
•	Date input 
•	Buttons to specify the tense (today, tomorrow, or future)
•	Textarea for a description of the task in order for the user to keep track of what their particular task demands
